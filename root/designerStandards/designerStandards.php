				<p>Break My Game events are created with the designer in mind. We
					want to not only provide you an opportunity to have your game play
					tested, we want to provide you the means to which your game will
					get play tested.</p>

				<p>With this in mind, games playtested at BMG events must meet a set
					of minimum requirements. The event organizer is responsible for the
					enforcement of these requirements. If a game does not meet the
					minimum requirements, the organizer will explain why the game is
					being denied, and will give helpful advice on how to bring the game
					up to make the adjustments needed to be accepted.</p>

					<p>Pieces must be actual pieces - no paper tokens or counters.
						Pieces borrowed from other games are acceptable. Pieces must be
						distinguishable so that players will be able to tell what they are
						supposed to represent. (example: different color pawns, or labels
						placed on poker chips.)</p>

					<p>Cards must be able to be shuffled. Cards on plain paper can be
						sleeved with card grade backing to accomplish this. Hand drawn
						cards will be accepted on a case by case basis, however it is
						preferred that cards be printed. Hand drawn corrections to cards
						are acceptable. Some ideas on how to get them printed and feeling
						like cards:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Print them out on thick card stock or business card stock and
							cut them out</li>
						<li>Print them out on regular paper, cut them out and put them in
							a card sleeve backed by card stock (magic cards work really well)</li>

					<p>If you are home printing your board it must be supported by a
						cardboard backing to give it a board game touch. A game board that
						is just a piece of paper will not be accepted. This rule also
						applies to any pieces that represent a game board, such as tiles.
						Some methods for accomplishing this:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Print the board design on paper and mount/paste it to either
							cardboard, posterboard or an old game board.</li>
						<li>Print the board design and laminate it (this also protects it
							from damage)</li>

					<p>Efforts should be made to present a game in a way that is
						visually appealing in order to attract players. Artwork plays an
						integral role in this endeavor, however we also understand that it
						can be difficult to devote time, effort, and sometimes money, into
						artwork for a game that's just in it's testing phases. Efforts
						should be made to add artwork when appropriate to boards cards,
						and other pieces in your game. Although boards and cards with no
						art work will not be allowed, exceptions are sometimes made when
						the design of the boards and cards are sufficient to make the game
						visually attractive.  See the examples below.</p>

                <p> We want game designs that are beyond the idea phase.  Not necessarily polished or heavily playtested, but at least has 
                had some thought and consideration put into it.  We believe the best way to gauge this is that the game components are at
                least similar to that of a real board game, for instance if using a board take the time to print out the design and
                paste it to a piece of cardboard. No art is required, we just want it in an easily playable condition.
                This goes a long way with playtesters and shows a commitment to your design.
