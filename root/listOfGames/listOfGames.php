						The Princely Courts is a game of intrigue, trust and treachery,
						based on the prisoner's dilemma.<br /> For years, the king has
						kept the peace between each of his sons and daughters; however,
						the king is growing in age. In order to decide his successor, the
						king has called upon those same sons and daughters to come to his
						court and show their political prowess. As one of those princes or
						princesses, you must earn the respect of the king and the
						kingdom's political elite by spreading your influence across the
						court and working with the other princes and princesses to improve
						the kingdom (Trust); all while sowing doubt in the other princes'
						and princesses' abilities (Treachery).
